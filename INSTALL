Install instructions
====================

Basically:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make install

If you want to install perlconsole system-wide, at least the last command must
be run as root (e.g. with sudo).

Dependencies
============

Perl Console depends on the Term::Readline module.

The first step of the installation procedure will warn you in case any of the
dependencies are not installed.
