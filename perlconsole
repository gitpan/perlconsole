=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl Console is a small program that implements a Read-eval-print loop: it lets
you evaluate Perl code interactively.  

It uses Readline to grab input, and provides completion with all the namespaces
loaded during your session. It allows you to load a module in your session and
test a function exported by it.

=head1 COMMANDS

It's possible to interact with the console with internal commands. The
following commands are supported in this version:

=over 4

=item B<:help> display the interactive help screen

=item B<:quit> quit the console

=item B<:set> set a preference (see PREFERENCES).

=back

=head1 RCFILE

PerlConsole will look for a rcfile located in your home directory called:
~/.perlconsolerc

Every line in that file will be evaluated as if they were issued in the console.
You can then load there your favorite modules, or even define your preferences.

Example of a valid ~/.perlconsolerc

    :set output = dumper
    use Date::Calc;


=head1 PREFERENCES

Preferences can be set with the B<:set> command. The following preferences are
supported in this version:

=over 4 

=item B<output> changes the output of evaluated code

=back

For details about commands, ype :help <command> within the console.
